## Project content and explanations

### Undoable String Builder

UndoableStringBuilder extends the regular StringBuilder with undo function.

It can undo next functions:
* append
* delete
* insert
* replace
* reverse

UndoableStringBuilder saves data in regular StringBuilder and all commands that have been made in Stack. Every time a change is made on the string it saves its undoCommand in the stack. When the user wants to undo it just takes the last undoCommand from the stack and applies it. To perform an undo command it uses regular StringBuilder commands. For example to undo a reverse we just need to reverse it again. If we want to undo an append we just need to delete whatâ€™s been appended.

You can find the UndoableStringBuilder classes in [this](https://github.com/NickBres/OOP0) repository.

### Observer

This project uses a simple Observer design pattern.
#### ConcreteMember
ConcreteMember class implements the Member interface.
Every member has its name (String) and UndoableStringBuilder shallow copy.
It uses the HandleEvent function to inform the member about changes that have been made in UndoableStringBuilder.
#### GroupAdmin
ConcreteMember class implements the Sender interface. 
It saves a list of Members and the original UndoableStringBuilder object.
GroupAdmin can manage members and make changes in UndoableStringBuilder.
If any changes are made to the UndoableStringBuilder, it will notify the members and sends them a new shallow copy.
If a member is deleted it will also free its data.

### Tests
There is a simple main function that can show how the program works. 
All other tests are made using the JUnit tool.
* UndoableStringBuilderTest - Checks every function in UndoableStringBuilder
* Tests - Checks observer using JVMUtilities to show memory usage after every change has been made
